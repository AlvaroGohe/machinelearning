# Talk 2: supervised learning

## Code demonstration

To complement the theory discussed in the talk, give a brief introduction to setting up a machine-learning pipeline
in Python. 

**Goals**:

1. Show how to get started with Python and download necessary packages, or use online notebooks such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
2. Load data set using `numpy`; show a few simple operations that `numpy` can do, e.g., vectorised/batched operations.
3. Show how to use `scikit-learn` as a "black box" for tasks such as classification and regression; will aim to understand the methods in later weeks, but this week we want to get comfortable with using the methods in practice.
