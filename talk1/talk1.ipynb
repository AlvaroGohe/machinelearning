    "\n",
    "> Get a working setup with Jupyter notebooks, making sure to have `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `jax`, `jupyter`and `matplotlib`  packages installed. Can do this locally (more effort, but then don't need an internet connection) or via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (much less effort to set up, but need internet connection and a Google account; Colab also provides limited GPU access which will be useful for neural network training later on in the reading group). \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, there are 2 options for installion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easiest**: Setting up a Google Colab as an alternative (also show how you can change between CPU, GPU, and TPU usage on Colab by going into the \"Runtime\" menu option). [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Copy and Paste this file there, and you will be ready to go! All packages will be available. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Copy**: Firstly, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open up VS Code, open up a terminal. Now its time to download packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 1*: pip install them. Type seperatley and then hit enter with the following statements into the terminal: `pip install numpy`, then `pip install -U scikit-learn`, `pip install -U jax`, `pip install jupyter` and `pip install -U matplotlib`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 2*: You can download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to manage the packages and find and download `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `jax`, `jupter` and `matplotlib`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rmk: In either case, explain difference between \"Code\" blocks and \"Text\" blocks in Jupyter notebook. Explain the fact that you can run cells in any order, and there is a \"global state\" where all the variables live. Encourage people to regularly test their notebooks by clicking \"Restart\" (deletes all the old variables) and rerun all cells in order to avoid [problems](https://erikjandevries.medium.com/when-and-how-jupyter-notebooks-fail-and-what-to-use-instead-a52c27dbaa4c)."
